# Spotitube [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/HANICA-DEA/spotitube.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/HANICA-DEA/spotitube) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/HANICA-DEA/spotitube/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/HANICA-DEA/spotitube?branch=master)

This repository contains a front-end for the final programming assignment 
of the course OOSE-DEA at the [HAN University of Applied Sciences](https://www.han.nl/).

## Hosted version

Use this version if you do not want to install it locally:

[Spotitube through HTTP](https://jenkins.aimsites.nl/spotitube/)

## Enabling CORS headers in your JavaEE container

To use this Spotitube Client with your own Spotitube Server, you will need to enable CORS headers
in your JavaEE container. 

This is required because the Client is served from a different domain than the Server. Your browser will only allow this 
if the Server has the CORS Headers set in its HTTP response. More information about this will be given during lessons.
 
## API

In general the API must conform the standards of a RESTFull API. It will use HTTP methods and expects HTTP statuscodes in its response.

### Methods used 

* GET : In case of acquiring one, or multiple resources.
* POST: In case of creating a resource.
* PUT: In case of modifying  a resource.
* DELETE: In case of deleting a resource.

### Response codes

The client will expect the following respond codes to be used

* 200: OK. A response to a successful GET, PUT or DELETE.
* 201: Resource has been created. A response to a successful POST.
* 400: Bad Request. Something is wrong with the request. This could be due to
a missing query-parameter for the token.
* 401: Unauthorized. Authorization has failed. This can happen if the user tried to log in, but supplied an invalid username/password.
* 403: Forbidden. The request was valid, but you have requested a resource for which are not authorized. This will probably mean you have provided a token that is invalid.
* 404: Not found. You have requested an endpoint that is not available.

### HATEOAS

Those that are aware of the concept HATEOAS might notice that this API is not HATEOAS. That is not a problem, HATEOAS is not within the scope of this excercise.

### Endpoints
The following endpoints are expected

#### Login

```
url:    /login 
method: POST
```

It will perform a request with an object in the body of the form

```
{
  "user":     "meron", 
  "password": "MySuperSecretPassword12341"
}
```

It will expect a response containing an object of the form

```
{
  "token":  "1234-1234-1234", 
  "user":   "Meron Brouwer"
}
```

This token is then stored in LocalStorage and used for each following
request.

#### Playlists

##### Get all Playlists

To acquire a list of all playlists:
```
url:              /playlists 
method:           GET
query parameter:  token
```

It will expect a response containing the complete list of playlists:

```
{
  "playlists" :[
               {
                  "id"    : 1,
                  "name"  : "Death metal",
                  "owner" : true,
                  "tracks": []
               },
               {
                  "id"    : 2,
                  "name"  : "Pop",
                  "owner" : false,
                  "tracks": []
               }
              ],
  "length"  :123445}
```

The property `length` should be in seconds and represents the total length of all playlists. The client will convert this to hh:mm:ss.

##### Delete a Playlist

To delete a playlist:
```
url:              /playlists/:id
method:           DELETE
query parameter:  token
```
It will expect a response containing the complete and modified list of playlists:

```
{
  "playlists" :[
               {
                  "id"    : 1,
                  "name"  : "Heavy Metal",
                  "owner" : true,
                  "tracks": []
               }
              ],
  "length"  :6445}
```

##### Add a Playlist

To add a playlist:
```
url:              /playlists
method:           POST
query parameter:  token
```

The body should contain the new playlist:
```
{
  "id"    : -1,
  "name"  : "Progressive Rock",
  "owner" : false,
  "tracks": []
},
```

Note that the client will set the id to -1, and the 'owner' variable to false. The server is responsible for generating a unique id, and setting the 'owner' variable accordingly. These must be set on the response object.

It will expect a response containing the complete and modified list of playlists:

```
{
  "playlists" :[
               {
                  "id"    : 1,
                  "name"  : "Heavy Metal",
                  "owner" : true,
                  "tracks": []
               },
               {
                  "id"    : 2,
                  "name"  : "Pop",
                  "owner" : false,
                  "tracks": []
               },
               {
                 "id"    : 3,
                 "name"  : "Progressive Rock",
                 "owner" : true,
                 "tracks": []
               },
              ],
  "length"  :123445}
```
The property `length` should be in seconds. The client will convert this to hh:mm:ss.

##### Edit a Playlist

To edit the name of a playlist:
```
url:              /playlists/:id
method:           PUT
query parameter:  token
```

The body should contain the modified playlist:
```
{
  "id"    : 1,
  "name"  : "Heavy Metal",
  "owner" : true,
  "tracks": []
},
```

It will expect a response containing the complete and modified list of playlists:

```
{
  "playlists" :[
               {
                  "id"    : 1,
                  "name"  : "Heavy Metal",

                  "id"    : 2,
                  "name"  : "Pop",
                  "owner" : false,
                  "tracks": []
               }
              ],
  "length"  :123445
}
```
The property `length` should be in seconds. The client will convert this to hh:mm:ss.
#### Tracks

##### Get all tracks 

To receive all tracks that are available

```
url:              /tracks
method:           GET
query parameter:  forPlaylist
query parameter:  token
```

The client will make this request when the user wants to add a track to a Playlist. In that case the query parameter 
`forPlaylist` is added to ensure the server only returns the Tracks that are not yet in the Playlist. The value of this query
parameter is the `id` of the Playlist.

It will expect a response containing the complete list of available tracks:

```
{
  "tracks": [
                   {
                       "id": 3,
                       "title": "Ocean and a rock",
                       "performer": "Lisa Hannigan",
                       "duration": 337,
                       "album": "Sea sew",

## TIPS
* To implement the DataMapper pattern you can use the code from the book, e.g. the AbstractMapper class. This class has to be modified a little to confom to the JDBC standard but is app. 80% functional.
* When you save the password in the database using a password type, you can check the value from the database against a hashed version of the password given by the user: ```if (DigestUtils.sha256Hex(pass_given_by_user).equals(pass_from_the_database))) ``` DigestUtils is a class from the Commons Codecs library:
```
        <dependency>
            <groupId>commons-codec</groupId>
            <artifactId>commons-codec</artifactId>
            <version>1.10</version>
        </dependency>
```

* To generate a unique token you can use the UUID class: ```UUID.randomUUID()```. Save the generated token in memory (e.g. a List or Map) or in the database.

## For local installation

To install the client locally you will need Node.js and angular-cli.

### Install Node.js

Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

### Install angular-cli

To install [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli), run the following command in admin/superuser mode:
```
  npm install -g @angular/cli
```

### Run the Client
 
You can now use Angular CLI to run a local server that hosts the Client. To do this, run the following command:

---
---
---

# Build
mvn clean package && docker build -t han.oose.dea/spotitube .

# RUN

docker rm -f spotitube || true && docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -p 4848:4848 --name spotitube han.oose.dea/spotitube


ng serve
```

This will run a server on http://localhost:4200.

So navigate your browser to

```
http://localhost:4200/
```
